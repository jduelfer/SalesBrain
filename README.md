# JSForce, Node.js, Angularjs, and Express Demo

## Overview
This demo is inspired by the MobilePack-AngularJS Demo pack released by developerforce. It is a very simple app that displays your org's accounts, let's you view them, and also let's you create new contacts. It uses Oauth2 and single-sign on, making it part of the Salesforce experience yet using the power of Node, Angular and Express.
