# JSForce, Node.js, Angularjs, and Express Demo

## Overview
This demo is inspired by the MobilePack-AngularJS Demo pack released by developerforce. It is a very simple app that displays your org's accounts, let's you view them, and also let's you create new contacts. It uses Oauth2 and single-sign on, making it part of the Salesforce experience yet using the power of Node, Angular and Express. 

Follow this link for a working demo connected to a dummy org: <a href="https://salesbrain.herokuapp.com/">SalesBrain</a>

Or if you have your own org and would like to try it out with node, just clone the respository then do 
<p> cd <path to repository>/SalesBrain </p>
<p> npm install </p>

To download all the node packages. Once you are ready, replace the oauth contents in index.js with those of your Connected App and then the command:

<p> npm start </p>

Your app should be running on <a href="http://localhost:3000/">local host<a/>. Good luck!!
